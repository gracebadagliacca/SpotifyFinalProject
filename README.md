# SpotifyFinalProject
# This project takes user input of an artist name and returns the albums and tracks of the artist.
# Each track output in the terminal specifies the explicit value (EXPLICIT or is NOT EXPLICIT)
# The program inserts the song data of the specified artist into a table; a new table is created for each user input 
# matplotlib then creates a bar chart of the specified artist's explicit/not explicit songs for easy side-by-side comparison
